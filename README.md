# Fandom Formatter
## Purpose 
Having a unified method for submitting original works has been challenging for some time. Many writers for Archive of Our Own (AO3) use Google Docs for writing and editing, yet have to translate the rich text into hand coded HTML for submission to the side. 

This project aims to ease that process by taking formatted text from a google doc and translating it into HTML.
